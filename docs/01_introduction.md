# Introduction
Owing to the importance of this skill for sporting performance for experienced and well-trained athletes, it is also critical to understand how we can optimise skill learning to enhance this skill. In experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, there is converging evidence showing that certain type of practices, as well as the distribution of it, contributes more effectively to the attainment of expertise than other types of practices7â€“10. If the effective learning paradigms discovered in this research is true, it could fundamentally alter the way coaches typically design practices for skill learning. However, as most of these studies have relied on simpler laboratory-based tasks using
novices as participants5 the translation to a real-world complex sport, such as alpine ski racing and with very skilled athletes is not clear. Since skiers face a large variety of conditions in training and competition, they must be able to adapt the pumping technique to these demands. Understanding which training paradigms that are most effective to prepare skilled athletes for this complex task is, therefore, important to address.
